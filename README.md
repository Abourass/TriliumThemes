## Instalation 
There are three methods you can use to install: 
1. You can use the example CSS files to make root level css with the @appCss attribute. **While this is easiest, you will not get the custom font for the code editor as you can use @import for fonts this method**
   * Purple Rain's CSS File
   * Rainbow in the Dark's CSS File 
2. You can overwrite the style css / and the options ejs file then use the build tools to build the source. This will let you choose the themes under options like any other theme. **I will do my absolute best to always keep my files up to date with the source**
   * Download the /src folder and overwrite the /src file in Trilium
   * Build using the build tools in Trilium
3. You can use the builds in the dist folder, however, I am not entirely sure the non-windows builds built correctly as I'm on windows. **Again, I will try my best to always stay up to date with Trilum**
   * Download the Windows x64 build - .7z **v0.28.3**
   * Download the Windows x64 build - .zip **v0.28.3**
   * Download the Linux x64 build **v0.28.3**
